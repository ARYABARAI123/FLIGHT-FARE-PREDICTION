## OVERVIEW 
Flight Fare Prediction is a project which focuses on the Flight Fares based on Different Features such as Aitrline, Source, Destination, etc. The Datatset is used for training ad modeing consist of 23 features.
The Project achieved an accuracy of 99.29% using KNN-Algorithm. This implementation is done in python, leveraging its rich ecosystem for machine learning tasks. Alongside KNN Regressor with K value ranging from 1 to 3, the project utilizes various other algorithm including Linear Regression with solvers such as MAE, MSE, MAPE, Theil's U1 and U2, BREUSCH-PAGAN TEST, Random Forest. This ensemle of algorithms contributes to accurate detection of Flight Fare Prediction using 23 features.
